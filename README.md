## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple web service provides a simple way managing user posts.
Is is Go web service written in Go that uses Postgres for data storage.


## Quick start <a name = "quickstart"></a>

Run fully functioning service with the database in docker containers using docker compose (assuming docker and docker compose are installed):
```
docker-compose up --build
```
In your browser go to http://localhost:3000/swagger/index.html

## Features <a name = "features"></a>

- REST standard (followed as much as possible)
- New users registration and logging them in uses a simple username/password pattern.
- Accessing posts and other resources are protected by JWT.  RSA public key scheme used in token creation and verification.
- For simplicity and given time constraints post‚Äôs multimedia attachments (image and video content) are stored in the database.  TODO: This needs to be changed to store the binary data in the file system.
- Smallest possible docker image using fromscratch base image.

## Design

### Tech
- go ‚Ä¶duh!
- go fiber - very fast API framework build on top Fasthttp
- go playground validator - structure validation
- go playgroud jwt - for token creation and validation
- brcypt - for password hashing
- swag - swagger
- pgx - a postgres driver
- sqlx - is a library which provides a set of extensions on go's standard database/sql library.

### Code

Project‚Äôs structure if fairly simple.  Here is run down of top level subdirectories:
- db: contains database initialization sql script files
- docs: contains swagger generated documentation files (to create them run command ‚Äúmake swag‚Äù
- keys: contains RSA public and private keys for token authentication (to create then run command ‚Äúmake cert‚Äù)
- pkg: contains all of the application logic

The application uses Domain Driven Design (DDD). ‚Äòpkg/domain‚Äô contains code for 3 domain bounded contexts. They are:
- users - contains everything related to user related use cases
- posts - contains  everything related to user posts related use cases.
- media - contains multimedia related code, such as downloading post images and videos

Each of the bounded contexts uses layered separation of responsibilities design pattern.  It uses dependency injection for layer interaction.  The layers are:
- repository - provides \database / store access
- service - provides domain‚Äôs business logic
- endpoint - provides API functionality, i.e. API handlers
- router - defines API routes

Also domain may contain definitions for domain‚Äôs data model, API DTO, and layer interface declarations

### Database

<img href="./db/diagram.png" />

An architectural decision was made not to delete any data.  Delete entity business use case is approached by having a deleted BOOLEAN column on ‚Äúposts‚Äù and ‚Äúpost_comments‚Äù tables.  This allows to retain for historical and auditing purposes all the data.

Since the data returned to the user is filtered WHERE deleted IS FALSE we use filtered indexes to efficiently get the relevant data.

Another performance improvement is use of the VIEWS.  This allows us to save database access calls when for example we need to return post data with filled in author‚Äôs email (or in future username).  Without this we would have to query posts and users tables, and in code match user information to each of the posts read from the database.  



### Developer world
Assuming Go, docker, git and make installed, here are simple instructions to get you up and running in no time

Get the code from github
```
  git clone https://github.com/PaulShpilsher/instalike.git
  cd instalike
```

Start Postgres server instance in a docker container (*Docker must be installed*)
```
  make postgres
```
todo: apply db/init.sql

Start web service:
```
  make start
```

Build:
```
  make build
```
This will build the code and put it in ./bin directory along with required supporting files (configuration and RSA keys for JWT)



## Configuration <a name = "config"></a>

This web service uses [node-config-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-config-ts) for configuration.
The config file is 
```
./config/default.json

{
  "port": 4040,
  "mongoUri": "mongodb://localhost:27017/acronyms",
  "seedFile": "./data/acronym.json"
}
```
You may change the values in that file. Also you can have settings applied based on a runtime environment.
Example:
set environment variable 
```
  NODE_ENV=production
```
then the service will use setting from *./config/env/production.json* config file.
```
  ./config/env/production.json
```
You can also use command line arguments to override settings.
```
  --port 5000
```

For full understanding of configuration features please refer to [node-config-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-config-ts)  documentation


## API <a name="api"></a>

### Get acronyms by *fuzzy* searching definitions
```
  GET /acronym?from=:fromlimit=:limit&search=:search
```
Query arguments:
- *:search* is a mandatory string what to search for (case insensitive)
- *:from* is a mandatory non-negative number for paging: how many results to skip
- *:limit* is a mandatory non-negative number for paging: maximum number of acronyms to return

Result is a JSON array of acronyms with definitions
```
  JSON:
  [
    {
      acronym: string
      definition: string
    },
    ...
  ]
```
Paging note: after getting a page of results if more data available the response header will contain an entry "next" with a path to the next page of results.
```
  GET /acronym?from=10limit=5&search=freack
  
  Response header (when more data available):
    next: /acronym?from=15limit=5&search=freack
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 200 (OK)
- In case of missing or invalid query parameters returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)

Testing
```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4040/acronym?from=50&limit=10&search=one'
```


### Get acronym's definitions
```
  GET /acronym/:acronym
```
Query arguments:
- *:acronym* a mandatory string of an acronym (case insensitive)

Result is a JSON object of an acronym and its definition
```
  JSON:
    {
      acronym: string
      definition: string
    }
```
*Since the client alreany has the acronym, an agument could be made for retuning just the acronym's definition.  For consitency I decided returning the "whole" object across all GET verbs.*
- On success returns: HTTP Status 200 (OK)
- When acronym does not exist returns: HTTP Status 404 (NOT_FOUND)

Testing
```
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4040/acronym/test99'
```


### Create new acronym with definition
```
  POST /acronym
  Header:
    Content-Type: application/json
  Body:
  {
    acronym: string
    definition: string
  }
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 201 (CREATED)
- If acronym already exist returns: HTTP Status 409 (CONFLICT)
- If either acronym or definition is missing returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)

Testing
```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:4040/acronym' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "acronym": "TEST99",
    "definition": "Test ninety nine"
}'
```


### Update acronym's definition</i>
```
  PUT /acronym/:acronym
  Header:
    Authorization: XXXXX
    Content-Type: application/json
  Body: {
    definition: string
  }
```
- On success returns: HTTP Status 204 (NO_CONTENT)
- On failure returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)
- On missing authorization header returns: HTTP Status 400 (UNAUTHORIZED)

Note: *This API uses an authorization header to ensure acronyms are protected.  Currently this implementation just checks for the presense of Authorization header. It does not validate the token.*

Testing
```
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4040/acronym/test99' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: auth-token' \
  --data-raw '{
    "definition": "Test ninety nine. Take 2"
}'
```


### Delete an acronym
```
  GET /acronym/:acronym
  Header:
    Authorization: XXXXX
```
Note: *This API uses an authorization header to ensure acronyms are protected.  Currently this implementation just checks for the presense of Authorization header. It does not validate the token.*

- On success returns: HTTP Status 204 (NO_CONTENT)
- On failure returns: HTTP Status 400 (BAD_REQUEST)
- On missing authorization header returns: HTTP Status 400 (UNAUTHORIZED)

Testing
```
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:4040/acronym/test99' \
  --header 'Authorization: auth-token'
```
